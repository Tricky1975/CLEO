# CLEO - Command Line Editor Oversimplefied

CLEO is a very extremely simplistic cli editor for the command line interface as used in Windows.
Up until Windows 10, there was the EDIT tool, but some idiot decided to remove it completely, and heavens knows why. No the transfer to 64bit is bullshit. They could recode other cli tools, so they could do it here as well.
Now up until recently I was a Mac user where I used Nano, but that is in Windows only truly working under cygwin.

I've decided to write my own. As the name suggests, this editor will be oversimplefied, so no neat features that are not needed (unless this tool goes viral with features getting in high demand).

### Hey Jeroen, why not use Notepad?

Two reasons. Notepad is beyond terrible, and that is actually an insult to all other things that are beyond terrible.
Second, notepad, opens a window and that is precisely what I do NOT want. Want wanted the editor to live inside the cli window and in there alone! That makes recommendations for better editors like notepad++, or geany or atom etc etc userless! :P

### Why not use VIM?

I hope you're kidding! If not, maybe I can recommend you to find a good psychiatrist since you really need one, or you wouldn't have asked me that question. And that summarizes how I think about VIM!

### WIP

This is yet a work in progress. I will only release binaries once the tool has been fully set up to work satisfactory.
Since this has been written in C# to work on .NET you may be able to use it on Mac and Linux as well when you have Mono installed. ;)
